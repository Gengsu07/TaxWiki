# Wiki Index

> **TL;DR**: The central navigation hub for this knowledge base. Start with the Master Learning Path to find your sequence through all chapters, browse the concept index (auto-populated by `.base` views), or jump directly to sources. Everything here updates automatically as content is ingested — no manual index maintenance needed [1].

---

## 1. Master Learning Path

The **[[_learning-path|Master Learning Path]]** is your starting point. It sequences all chapters into a curriculum, tells you which order to tackle them, where to branch based on your interests, and how everything fits together.

```mermaid
graph LR
    MLP["Master Learning Path"] --> F["Foundations"]
    MLP --> CC["Cross-Cutting"]
    MLP --> CH["...future chapters"]

    style MLP fill:#f9a825,color:#333
    style F fill:#66bb6a,color:#fff
    style CC fill:#42a5f5,color:#fff
    style CH fill:#e0e0e0,color:#666,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

> **Rule of thumb**: If you don't know where to start, start at the Master Learning Path. It's designed to be the single entry point for every learner [1].

## 2. Chapter Learning Paths

Each chapter has its own `_learning-path.md` — a structured curriculum that sequences the concepts within that topic. Pick a direction from the master path, then dive into the chapter below.

| # | Learning Path | Chapter Folder | Nodes | Status |
|---|---------------|----------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [[concept/foundations/_learning-path\|Foundations]] | `foundations/` | 0 | draft |
| 2 | [[concept/cross-cutting/_learning-path\|Cross-Cutting Concepts]] | `cross-cutting/` | 0 | draft |

*More chapter learning paths appear here automatically as concepts are ingested into topic chapters.*

### How to Use Learning Paths — Step by Step

1. **Start at the Master Learning Path** — it sequences the chapters themselves
2. **Begin at Foundations** — fundamental concepts every topic builds on. No prerequisites.
3. **Browse Cross-Cutting Concepts** — ideas that span multiple domains. Best after 1+ topic chapters.
4. **Pick a topic chapter** learning path that matches your interest (appears as chapters are created)
5. **Follow the sequence linearly**, or take branches when you want to specialize
6. **Each node links to a concept page** with full details, sources, and related pages

```mermaid
graph TB
    S1["1. Open Master<br/>Learning Path"] --> S2["2. Complete<br/>Foundations"]
    S2 --> S3["3. Pick a topic<br/>chapter"]
    S3 --> S4["4. Follow chapter<br/>learning path"]
    S4 --> S5["5. Take branches<br/>to specialize"]
    S5 --> S6["6. Revisit Cross-Cutting<br/>for deeper connections"]

    style S1 fill:#f9a825,color:#333
    style S2 fill:#66bb6a,color:#fff
    style S3 fill:#42a5f5,color:#fff
    style S4 fill:#ab47bc,color:#fff
    style S5 fill:#ff7043,color:#fff
    style S6 fill:#26c6da,color:#fff
```

## 3. Concept Index

![[concept-index.base#Concepts by Chapter]]

> **Auto-populating**: This card view groups concepts by chapter and updates in real time as new concept pages are created. No manual entry required [2].

---

## 4. Sources

![[source-inventory.base#All Sources]]

> **Auto-populating**: This table lists every ingested source with its file name, date, source count, status, and tags. New rows appear automatically when source summary pages are created [2].

---

## 5. Quality Dashboard

![[lint-dashboard.base#Draft Pages (needs review)]]

> **Auto-populating**: This view surfaces all pages marked `status: draft`, helping you identify content that needs review or completion. The full lint dashboard with additional filters is at [[lint-dashboard.base]] [2].
